### Hi there ğŸ‘‹

I am an assistant professor of urban design and analytics at TU Delft, with a keen interest in understanding how urban analytics driven by spatial-temporal data can improve urban design. 

ğŸŒ±  &nbsp; I teach and conduct research at the intersections of urban design, urban resilience, and spatial data science, with an interest in the inter- and trans-disciplinary implications of those intersections.

ğŸ”­  &nbsp; I am passionate about asking (and sometimes answering) spatial and non-spatial research questions, mostly with R.
